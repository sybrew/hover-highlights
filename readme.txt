Adds custom CSS to the Gutenberg editor to highlight blocks on hover and focus.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a simple CSS rule to the Gutenberg editor that highlights blocks on hover and focus. The highlight is a dashed outline with a subtle box-shadow effect.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/hover-highlights` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't the highlight show up? =

Make sure you're using the Gutenberg editor and that you're hovering over a block. The highlight only shows up on hover and focus, so you may need to click on a block to give it focus.
