Adds highlighting on hover with a distraction-free experience for the Gutenberg/Block Editor.

== Description ==

Hover Highlights is a simple WordPress plugin that adds a subtle highlight effect to the Gutenberg/Block Editor. When you hover over a block, it gets highlighted with a dashed outline and a box-shadow. The highlight disappears when you focus on the block to reduce distraction.

This plugin is ideal for content creators who want to visually distinguish individual blocks within the Block Editor.

_The code and this readme are mostly written by ChatGPT._

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hover-highlights` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
