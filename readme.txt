Hover Highlights is a simple WordPress plugin that adds a subtle highlight effect to the Gutenberg/Block Editor. When you hover over a block, it gets highlighted with a dashed outline and a box-shadow. The highlight disappears when you focus on the block to reduce distraction.

This plugin is ideal for content creators who want to visually distinguish individual blocks within the Block Editor.
